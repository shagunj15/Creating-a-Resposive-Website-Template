# Creating-a-Responsive-Website-Template
<strong>Created a simple and responsive website template with a header, footer, cover picture, and picture grid, which can be further modified to make any website you want (used HTML, CSS, flexbox, CSS-grid).</strong>

It's important to understand that to create a simple layout, when making a website, all you need are the basic tools, that is, HTML, flexbox, CSS, and CSS-grid. I initially wrote a simple layout in HTML consisting of 4 divs, one for the header, cover picture, picture grid, and footer. <br><br>
For the header div, I made it into a nav bar by using the "ul" and "li" tags, as well as defining a class in which I used flexbox. To make the header responsive I used a media query. Using this, when the screen goes below 600px, the nav bar changes it's font-size and padding so it fits into the new screen size and looks better too.

There are many websites that show a big cover picture or quote or something like this just below the header. This is what I worked on next. For the cover picture, I used a class which, again, uses flexbox. To add an image, you will have to just add an "img" tag and make it a specific height (specify the height in flexbox). To make it responsive, I've used "vh" which stands for 'viewport height'. So instead of using height: 500px; I've used height: 50vh. This makes the cover image 50% of the screen size.

In a lot of web pages, I've noticed that there is a grid of images that you can click on to go to other parts of the website. So to make this I've used CSS-grid. For the footer, I have just aligned the text to the center but if you want to add images or other information, you can modify the footer tag by using flexbox.

It's important to note that this is just a basic template, so many things need to be added to make it into a proper website.
